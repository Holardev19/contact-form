## My process
1. I built the html structure
2. I designed it with css and added breakpoint for media responiveness
3. I add interactivity with javascript. First, I added the colors signifying error. Then, I dynamically inserted the checkboxes when the user clicks. I worked on the error instances regarding email. Lastly, I worked on the success toast. 
4. I reviewed the layout and typography if it matches the given design.
5. I tested the logic again and again.

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Web-first workflow
-JavaScript

### What I learned

I learnt how javascript logic works in validating email. I also learnt the usefulness of functions.

To see how you can add code snippets, see below:

### Continued development

- Using functions
- Interpreting logic into javascript code
- Building with react and tailwind css

### Useful resources
